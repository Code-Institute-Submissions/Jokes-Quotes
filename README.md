### Business goals of the website:
* To create a website that offers fun and inspiration. 
* To deliver engaging content and an enjoyable user experience.
* To drive traffic and user engagement through social sharing. 
* To encourage the user to make repeated visits to the site and encourage repeated sharing of content. 
* To enable users to make contact easily with site owners. 
* To enable users to contribute their own jokes and quotes. 

### User goals:
* To find jokes and/or quotes in an enjoyable and entertaining format. 
* To have fun and be inspired.
* To find entertaining experiences online which include uplifting, interesting and novel websites. 
* To be able to follow the site on social media platforms and/or share the content easily on social media. 
* To be able to contact the site easily in order to ask questions, make enquiries or contribute original material. 

## **UX**

The user types can be defined as one of the following:

* Users searching for topics such as humour, fun, jokes, inspiration, quotes and all related search terms. 
* Users searching specifically for jokes and/or quotes.
* Active users with the intention of sharing on social media channels including Facebook & Twitter.
* Content Marketers
* Niche Bloggers
* Users who search specifically for joke or quote generators. 


These groups make up the target audience and each user type has a reason or need to visit the site. The site has been designed to meet those needs as well as the needs of the business.

Clear sections which relate specifically to all of the user types above are built into the website's design.

A mobile first approach was taken to create this project with consideration of ease of use and navigation to each of the features/sections. 

### **User Stories**

1. As a user seeking entertainment, I want to find jokes and quotes quickly and easily, so that I can satisfy my own interests. 

2. As a fan of jokes and/or quotes, I want to find new content, so that I can enjoy it and share it with friends.  

3. As a consumer, I want to be entertained, have fun and be inspired, so that I can enjoy the experience and share it with friends.  

4. As a potential contributor, I want to submit my own jokes and quotes, so that I can get involved and share them with others. 

5. As a content marketer, I want to find original content and catchy material, so that I can use it to liven up my output.

6. As a niche blogger, I want to find interesting content for my blog, so that it stays fresh and appealing to my followers. 



Further information and screenshots showing how this project meets the user's needs can be
found in the separate [TESTING.md](https://github.com/JohnW876/johnwithey1/blob/master/TESTING.md) file.

### **Wireframe mockups:**
Below is a link to the project's wireframe mockups which were created using Balsamiq Wireframes software prior to the build to help with visualisation of features and layout. 

https://github.com/JohnW876/Jokes-Quotes/tree/master/documentation/wireframes
 
Wireframe mockups were created for every page of the website at mobile, tablet and desktop sizes and I referred to them throughout the build. 

The only major departure from my original wireframes was to combine the separate forms into a single contact and submissions form. 
In trying to meet user needs, the two forms were conceived as separate features at the design stage but during development it was obvious that combining them 
removed unnecessary duplication whilst offering an improved and simplified user experience. 

### **User Expectations:**
* What will they expect to see? - Users will expect to see immediate content related to their search terms stated above. They will want to find this on the home page and not want to spend time looking for it as there are many other sites competing for their attention in this category. 

* Does the site look credible and trustworthy? - Many elements will contribute to the first impression of a trustworthy site. These include, clear and intuitive navigation, good design and functionality. 

* Does the site offer what the user wants? - The features will need to meet the user's goals easily and deliver a fun and inspiring user experience. 

* Does the site seem valuable enough for users to stay and return? - As stated in the main goals of the website, the content will need to engage and the experience must be valuable and entertaining. 
  Making this experience a success and guiding the user to share with other users should deliver value and promote return visits. 
  Offering the ability for users to submit their own jokes and quotes which will be displayed on the site should increase return visits.

### **Market Research:**
* When considering the question of why would a user want to use this site, it was important to look at demand and conduct some research. 

* Using the Google Trends search tool we can study users interests via search terms over time. 
  If we run a search for related terms such as funny websites or fun and trivia, there have been many surges of activity in the last 12 months with an increase in interest of 90% for humour related topics. 
  The global pandemic has undoubtedly contributed to this with people being forced to stay at home due to government lockdowns. 

* It’s safe to say that users are bored and looking for entertainment. Unsurprisingly, the market trend figures show a huge increase in searches for this type of website over the last 12 months globally. 
  Other related topics such as boredom show an increase in Google searches of 200% and increased searches for jokes of 60%. 

* The other side of our site covers inspiration as a topic and Google trends shows that searches for inspiring quotes was consistently high over the last 12 months.
  Searches for inspiring quotes in hard times showed an increase of 140%. 

* So, combining jokes and inspiring quotes into one site allows us to reach these users who are demonstrating strong interest in these subjects. 

## **Features**

* The site has clear, simple and easy to find navigation.

* The main focus of the site is a scrolling homepage featuring clear sections for both jokes and quotes. 

* There are main navigation links and social media links on both pages.

* There are social share buttons close to the generator buttons on the homepage. 


### **Homepage**
There are a number of carefully chosen features on the homepage:

* There is a welcome message at the top of the page to quickly introduce the purpose of the site and guide the user to the main features. 

* Scrolling down the user comes to the joke section first with an image carousel of funny images.

* Directly below is a heading that directs the user to select a joke category (via the dropdown) and click the button to display consecutive jokes. This has all been kept deliberately simple and intuitive.

* The joke and quote buttons change colour when hovered over and glow when clicked to offer user feedback and encourage interactivity.

* There are social share buttons for Facebook and Twitter directly under the buttons to encourage sharing. 

* Scrolling further down the page, the user comes to the quotes section which is similar to jokes above but features a lightbox of images that open up to a large viewer when clicked. 

* The user can choose to view the images immediately or select the dropdown menu and choose a quote category. Clicking on the button returns a random quote from that category and consecutive clicks continues to supply more quotes. 

* The navigation bar clearly lets the user know about the different sections of the website and have been positioned in order of priority and in a natural flow from left to right. The clear headings also allow users to jump to their immediate area of interest if they wish. 
 
* Below that in the footer are links to social media which change colour when scrolled over to signify that they’re live, to encourage use and to create more impact. 

These features are designed to fulfil the needs of users from the user stories above. 

 
### **Contact & Submissions page**
* A single contact form for user enquiries, questions and suggestions. The form can also be used to submit user jokes and quotes. 

* Successful completion of the form will display a message on screen to alert the user. 

* If the user wishes to reset the form manually they can do so via the reset button. 

* Once successfully submitted, the site owner will receive an email notification via the Email.js service. 


### **Features to implement in future**
When considering the trade off between importance and viability, the following features could not be implemented at this stage but would make great additions in future:

* Increased user choice - Due to cost restraints, this site was limited to using public apis with a few categories. Future versions could perhaps include more categories of jokes and quotes.
 
* Search & Save functionality - I would like to add this feature so that users could view, add or share their favourites from the site. 


## **Technologies Used**
* [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) was the api used for the quotes section.
* [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) was the api used for the jokes section.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) Gitpod IDE was used to develop the website.
* HTML, CSS and Javascript are used in this project.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework is used to make the website responsive on all devices.
* [Layoutit](https://www.layoutit.com/build) is a tool used to help visualize Bootstrap grid layouts.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) is used to provide social media icons.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is used to provide styling to all type on the website. 
* [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) were used prior to commencing coding to help with UX design, pre-visualisation and layout and were consulted throughout development.
* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) were used to inspect the code, test the data and preview changes on all device sizes.

### **Acknowledgements**
Inspiration for this project came from being fed up with the misery caused by the global pandemic.
The desire to create the opposite of doom and gloom, in some very small way, led to the idea of Jokes & Quotes.  

I'd like to thank my mentor Aaron Sinnott, once again, for helping with positive and constructive feedback during the project!
